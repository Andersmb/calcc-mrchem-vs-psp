Lmod has detected the following error: Your site prevents the automatic
swapping of modules with same name. You must explicitly unload the loaded
version of "OpenMPI/4.1.1-GCC-11.2.0" before you can load the new one. Use swap
to do this:

   $ module swap OpenMPI/4.1.1-GCC-11.2.0 OpenMPI/4.0.3-GCC-9.3.0

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable
LMOD_DISABLE_SAME_NAME_AUTOSWAP to "no" to re-enable same name autoswapping.
